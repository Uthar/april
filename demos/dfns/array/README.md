## Dyalog Array Processing Dfns

<!-- /TITLE -->

These are Dyalog's dfns used for general array processing. Their original source is (Dyalog's dfns page)[http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_contents.htm]. They are included in April's demo test suite, so you can run tests of these functions by first evaluating `(april:load-demos)` to load the functions and then `(april:run-tests)` to run the tests.
