## Dyalog Tree Processing Dfns

<!-- /TITLE -->

These are Dyalog's dfns used for processing tree structures. Their original source is (Dyalog's tree processing dfns page)[http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_Trees.htm]. They are included in April's demo test suite, so you can run tests of these functions by first evaluating `(april:load-demos)` to load the functions and then `(april:run-tests)` to run the tests.
