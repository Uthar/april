### Common array processing functions

This package contains tools for array processing, many of which are part of APL's standard feature set. This package is now mostly deprecated; its functions were used by April in the past to implement eagerly evaluated array transformations but they have become obsolete with April's move to lazy evaluation. The `obsolete.lisp` file contains some functions that were deprecated even earlier. Some of Aplesque's utilities are still used in April so it hasn't yet been relegated to the attic.
