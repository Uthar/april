## Dyalog String Processing Dfns

<!-- /TITLE -->

These are Dyalog's dfns used for processing text strings and character arrays. Their original source is [Dyalog's dfns page](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_contents.htm), and they include the collection of string processing dfns, the line vector processing dfns ([see Dyalog's line vector functions homepage](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_Line_vectors.htm)) and the functions for blank removal ([see Dyalog's blank removal functions homepage](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_Blank_removal.htm)). They are included in April's demo test suite, so you can run tests of these functions by first evaluating `(april:load-libs)` to load the functions and then `(april:run-tests)` to run the tests.
