## Dyalog Numeric Processing Dfns

<!-- /TITLE -->

These are Dyalog's dfns used for numeric operations. Their original source is [Dyalog's dfns page](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_contents.htm). This library includes dfns from the whole number, rational number, real number and complex number processing collections. They are included in April's demo test suite, so you can run tests of these functions by first evaluating `(april:load-demos)` to load the functions and then `(april:run-tests)` to run the tests.
