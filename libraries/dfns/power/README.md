## Dyalog Power Operators

<!-- /TITLE -->

These are Dyalog's collection of specialized power operators. Their original source is [Dyalog's dfns page](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_contents.htm). They are included in April's demo test suite, so you can run tests of the operators by first evaluating `(april:load-demos)` to load the functions and then `(april:run-tests)` to run the tests.
