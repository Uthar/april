## Dyalog Graph Processing Dfns

<!-- /TITLE -->

These are Dyalog's dfns used for processing graphs, including weighted graphs. Their original source is [Dyalog's graph functions page](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_Graphs.htm) as well as [Dyalog's collection of functions for weighted graphs](http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_wGraphs.htm). They are included in April's demo test suite, so you can run tests of these functions by first evaluating `(april:load-libs)` to load the functions and then `(april:run-tests)` to run the tests.
